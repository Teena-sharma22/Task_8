## SuperMarket Analysis
This project analyzes supermarket sales data.

## What I did:
Loaded the data from SuperMarket Analysis.csv

Removed unnecessary columns: gross margin percentage, Rating, Payment, cogs

Converted the Date column to datetime format

Created a new column Order Month in the format Month-Year (e.g., Jan-2024)

Saved the cleaned data as clean_data.csv

## Dashboard:
Created a simple dashboard with graphs and slicers (filters)

The dashboard shows monthly sales trends and product information

Users can filter data by month, product category, etc.
